= SimpleLocalization Plugin

This plugin supports a simple one language localization for Ruby on Rails and was born in the first half of 2006 by searching
a simple way to localize model and attribute names of ActiveRecord models. Time after time more and more features became
necessary and the plugin grew. It supports a simple one language localization for Ruby on Rails based on a language file,
localizes the Date and Time classes, many helpers, some methods of ActiveSupport, the ActiveRecord error messages and
provides two ways to localize models and their attributes. You can also use the language file to easily localize your own
application. You'll find an overview just below.

If you have some questions, want to report a bug or just want to talk about the plugin you can write a
comment[http://projects.arkanis-development.de/simple_localization/index.html#your_comment] at the homepage of this
plugin.


== Overview and key concepts

* Easy installation and integration.
* Can be easily customized to your needs by turning specific features on and off.
* Easy to read and write language files using YAML and if needed Ruby, too.
* Localizes:
  * ActiveRecord model and attribute names (by source code or language file)
  * ActiveRecord error messages
  * ActiveRecord helpers
  * Number helpers
  * Date and Time classes and date helpers
  * Array extensions (<code>Array#to_sentence</code>)
  * Country names (just need to be inserted into the language file)
  * Your application (add your custom entries to the language file)
* A more CSS friendly ActionView @field_error_proc@.

To make the plugin more felxible and extendable most of the functionality is split into small "features". These "features" are source
files located in the <code>lib/features</code> directory of the plugin and each one localizes a small part of Ruby on Rails. When
initializing the plugin you can choose the featurs you want to use. This avoids conflicts in case you have already localized some
parts of your application by other means.

To easily support new languages all language specific strings are extracted into language files. These language files can be found
in the +languages+ directory of the plugin (or a custom directory) and are written in the YAML format. They also contain meta
data about the author of the language file and can be extended with Ruby code (eg. configuring the Rails Inflector). More detailed
information or instructions for creating a new language file can be found in the corresponding section at the end of this file.


== Installation

You can install the newest version of the plugin (for Rails 1.2.x) directly from the SubVersion repository:

  ./script/plugin install http://svn.arkanis-development.de/projects/rails_plugins/current/simple_localization

The next and already last thing is to call the +simple_localization+ method at the end of your <code>environment.rb</code> file:

  simple_localization :language => :de

With this you're done. The <code>:language</code> parameter lets you define the language you want to use. Just specify
the name of the language file without the <code>.yml</code> extension as a symbol or string. Currently only a german language
file (named <code>de.yml</code>) and an english language file (as reference and template for new languages) exists though. This
one method call gives you quite more control over the plugin but this is described in the next chapter.

There is also an development branch for a Rails 1.1.x compartible version. To install this one you just have to install the plugin from
another repository path and then call the +simple_localization+ method like described above.

  ./script/plugin install http://svn.arkanis-development.de/projects/rails_plugins/current/simple_localization-rails-1.1


== The magic of the +simple_localization+ method

With the +simple_localization+ method you can control how the plugin is set up and which features are loaded. It takes a hash of
options and the main purpose of this method is to initialize the plugin (therefor called in <code>environment.rb</code>) and to specify
which language file should be used:

  simple_localization :language => :de

The second and more powerful purpose of this method is to control which features should be loaded. Just specify an option with the
name of the feature source file and set it to +false+ to prevent it from loading:

  simple_localization :language => :de, :class_based_field_error_proc => false

This example will initialize the plugin with a german language file named <code>de.yml</code> but without loading the
<code>class_based_field_error_proc.rb</code> feature file. To make this more readable you can also use <code>:only</code> and
<code>:except</code> options like known from Rails before and after filters:

  simple_localization :language => :de, :except => [:class_based_field_error_proc, :localized_date_and_time]

  simple_localization :language => :de, :only => :localized_models

If you use the language files to localize your application (the localized_application feature) it may come in handy to move the directory containing
the language files to another more public place.

  simple_localization :language => :de, :lang_file_dir => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/app/languages", :only => [:localized_application]

This example expects the language files to be located in the <code>app/languages</code> directory of your application. By default language
files are located in the +languages+ directory of the Simple Localization plugin.


== Available features

This is a list describing the currently available features. Each one can be turned on or off to best match your needs. Detailed information about a
feature can be found in the RDoc documentation of the feature source file.


=== Localized model and attribute names (lib/features/localized_models.rb)

Provides a way to specify localized model and attribute names for ActiveRecord models. Asume the following model Computer has the attributes
+name+, +description+, +ip_address+ and +user+.

  class Computer < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :user
    validates_presence_of :name, :ip_address, :user
    localized_names 'Der Computer',
      :name => 'Der Name',
      :description => 'Die Beschreibung',
      :ip_address => 'Die IP-Adresse',
      :user => 'Der Besitzer'
  end

This stores the localized (in this case german) name of the model and it’s attributes in the model class. The first parameter of the +localized_names+
method is the name of the model followed by a hash defining the localized names for the attributes.

The feature also overwrites ActiveRecords +human_attribute_name+ method to return the localized names if available. The model name can be
accessed by the class method +localized_model_name+.

  Computer.localized_model_name               # => 'Der Computer'
  Computer.human_attribute_name(:ip_address)  # => 'Die IP-Adresse'


=== Localized model and attribute names using the language file (lib/features/localized_models_by_lang_file.rb)

This feature provides a way to localize ActiveRecord models based on translated model and attribute names in the language file.
Where the localized_models feature depends on translated names written in the source code of the models this feature reads all
necessary strings from the loaded language file.

This feature is the right choice if your application should support multiple languages, but only one at runtime. If your application is
strictly developed for just one language localized_models may is the better choice.

To localize a model with this feature you just have to add the necessary entries to the +models+ section to the languge file. The
following example localizes the +Computer+ model and it‘s attributes +name+, +description+, +ip_address+ and +user+.

  models:
    computer:
      name: Der Computer
      attributes:
        name: Der Name
        description: Die Beschreibung
        ip_address: Die IP-Adresse
        user: Der Besitzer

This feature will convert the name of the model class (+Compuer+) using <code>String#underscore</code> (results in +computer+) and
will look in the corresponding subsection of the models section. Each model section in turn contains the name of the model ("Der Computer")
and a map translating the model attributes. Like the +localized_models+ feature this one defines the +localized_model_name+
method to access the localized model name and modifies the +human_attribute_name+ to use the localized attributes names.

  Computer.localized_model_name               # => 'Der Computer'
  Computer.human_attribute_name(:ip_address)  # => 'Die IP-Adresse'


=== Localized application (lib/features/localized_application.rb)

This feature allows you to use the language file to localize your application. You can add your own translation strings to the +app+
section of the language file and read them with the +l+ global method. You can use this method in your controllers, views, mail templates,
simply everywhere.

  app:
    title: Simple Localization Rails plugin
    subtitle: The plugin should make it much easier to localize Ruby on Rails
    headings:
      wellcome: Wellcome to the RDoc Documentation of this plugin

  l(:title) # => "Simple Localization Rails plugin"
  l(:headings, :wellcome) # => "Wellcome to the RDoc Documentation of this plugin"

The +l+ method is just like the <code>ArkanisDevelopment::SimpleLocalization::Language#[]</code> operator but is limited to the app
section of the language file. There is no need to access language file sections of other features.


=== Localized ActiveRecord error messages (lib/features/localized_error_messages.rb)

Overwrites the english ActiveRecord error messages with localized ones from the language file. If the user submits an invalid form Rails´
+error_messages_for+ helper generates a box detailing why the record is invalid. This feature localizes the error messages used to build the
box. However to get a completely localized error box you'll have to localize your models (localized_models or localized_models_by_lang_file
feature) as well as the ActiveRecord helpers (localized_active_record_helpers feature).


=== Localized ActiveRecord helpers (lib/features/localized_active_record_helpers.rb)

Localizes the +error_messages_for+ helper. Uses the language file to generate the heading and explaination paragraph of the error box and
makes it also possible to redefine the generated HTML output using an associated block.


=== Localized Date and Time classes (lib/features/localized_date_and_time.rb)

Localizes the +Time+ and +Date+ classes. Updates the month and day name constants of the +Date+ class with proper localized ones from
the language file. Also makes the <code>Time#strftime</code> method using the month and day names of the +Date+ class (based on the
work[http://poocs.net/articles/2005/10/04/localization-for-rubys-time-strftime] of Patrick Lenz).

The date and time formats used by the +to_formatted_s+ method are updated, too.


=== Localized array extensions (lib/features/localized_array.rb)

Localizes the <code>Array#to_sentence</code> method added by ActiveSupport.


=== Localized date helpers (lib/features/localized_date_helpers.rb)

Localizes the +date_select+ and +distance_of_time_in_words+ helpers. These helpers are used by many other helpers to and therefor
many other helpers gets localized too.


=== Localized country names (lib/features/localized_form_options_helpers.rb)

Updates the country names used by the FormOptionsHelper module with localized names from the language file.


=== Localized number helpers (lib/features/localized_number_helpers.rb)

Modifies the number helpers of Rails to use a localized seperator, delimiter, percision and currency unit.


=== Class based ActionView +field_error_proc+ (lib/features/class_based_field_error_proc.rb)

This feature replaces the default ActionView +field_error_proc+ which is responsible for marking form fields with invalid input.
The original one wraps invalid form fields into and div element of the class +fieldWithErrors+.

  <div class="fieldWithErrors"><input type="text" class="txt" ... /></div>

The new one just adds the class @invalid@ to the corresponding form field element.

   <input type="text" class="txt invalid" ... />

This feature is based on a code snippet[http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/HowtoChangeValidationErrorDisplay] of Duane Johnson found in the
Rails wiki and isn’t really a localization feature. However while working with the ActiveRecord error messages the new div-element around invalid
fields was one of the most annoying things of Rails. So this feature can my be considered as a "goody".


== Structure of the language files

The language files contain all language specific strings the plugin uses and are written in simple YAML. Take a look at the english language file
(<code>languages/en.yml</code>) and you'll see how simple they are.

YAML may be nice but sometimes a language may require more complex things (eg. configuring the Rails Inflector). Usually these complex tasks
can be done by some Ruby magic and therefor you can extend a YAML language file with Ruby code. This is done by creating a Ruby file with the same
name as the YAML language file but with an +rb+ extension instead of an +yml+ extension. The Ruby file will be loaded right after the YAML file.
For example <code>languages/en.yml</code> contains the translated language strings and <code>languages/en.rb</code> could contain some
complex Ruby code to further setup the english language.

The YAML language file also contains some information about the author of the language file. This information can be accessed using the
<code>ArkanisDevelopment::SimpleLocalization::Language#about</code> method.

By default all language files are located in the +languages+ direcotry of the plugin. You can specify your own directory with the
<code>:lang_file_dir</code> option of the +simple_localization+ method.


== Create a new language file

It’s very easy to define new languages for this plugin. Just copy the english language file (<code>languages/en.yml</code>) and translate the entries
into your language. If you need to do some Ruby stuff to setup your language (eg. configuring the Rails Inflector) you can do this in the Ruby file with
the same name as your language file.

For example if you want to create a france language file you could just copy <code>en.yml</code> to <code>fr.yml</code> and translate the necessary
strings. If you need some Ruby stuff you can create a file named <code>fr.rb</code> and write usual Ruby code which will be loaded right after the
YAML file.
