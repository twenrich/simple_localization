= SimpleLocalization

This plugin supports a very simple one language (currently german) localization
for Ruby on Rails. It overwrites the default ActiveRecord error messages and
month names in language.rb.

It also defines a kind of domain specific language to make it possible to write
the localized names of the model attributes directly to the model class:

 localized_model_name 'Der Kommentar'
 localized_attribute_names :name => 'Dein Name',
                           :mail => 'Die eMail-Adresse',
                           :website => 'Die Website',
                           :title => 'Der Titel',
                           :content => 'Der Inhalt'

To get greater controll over the error_messages_for helper and to make it use
the localized names, I redefined it to use the partial template 'shared/errors'
to generate the error message box.

As a last step this plugin changes the wrapper code for invalid input fields
from a div element

 <div class="fieldWithErrors">...</div>

to a span element

 <span class="fieldWithErrors">...</span>

This makes formes more valid if you use block level elements to encapslate your
input elements (like I do).

== Installation

Well, since this plugin is more or less a quick'n diry development to just make
Rails run with german language there is currently no installation code. To
install this plugin you'll just have to copy the partial template from
'app/views/shared/_errors.rhtml' into your applications view directory. This is
all.

I'll create a installation script as soon as needed.

== Changing this plugin to use another language

There are only two files which contain language specific information:

[language.rb]
  This files overwrites the ActiveRecord default error messages and the month
  names. You can change this easily.

[app/views/shared/_errors.rhtml]
  The partial template used to create the error message box. You can change this
  to what ever your application fits best.
